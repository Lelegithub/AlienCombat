# AlienCombat
2D Space Shooter inspired by Space Invaders developed in Unity3D
I have :

- Used latest Unity LTS version (2019.4) with and Android Target and a target resolution of 640*1136 (Mobile Standard).
- Saved Player progress in an **encrypted form** for enhanced safety 
- Included All gameplay related constants should be stored in different **Scriptable Objects** you can find in the folder "Game Config" 
- Used **Unity.Addressables** for asset management 
- Implemented an **MVC-pattern Game Architecture** so it can be highly easy to extend and manage
- Developed a **finite state machine (FSM)** for the Player's logic
- Included the **Zenject dependency injection (DI)** and inject the main Database reference
- Used **async/await syntax** and **UniTask** when dealing with asynchronous calls.
